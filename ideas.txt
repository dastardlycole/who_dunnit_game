---What is the game about---
It is a who dunnit game for users who are playing on the same laptop

there are users in a room and one killer in their midst

each round, the killer kills a player and the group have to pick one person to eliminate who they think is the killer

if the killer is eliminated before there are two players left. the killer wins

if the group chooses the killer before then, the group wins

---ideas---

I think we should remove time.sleep and just be passing the computer around so each person enters a name as if they were the killer and passes the device

the name each person enters must be in the list of names regardless of if it's a fake kill or not

we should say give the laptop to name and ask is name with the laptop then print what we wan to say

class of people and a subclass of killer whose kill will actually kill

a summarry after each round maybe a class of round for that idk
